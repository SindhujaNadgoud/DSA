The problem solution goes smthng like , 


The formula is after contructiong a graph, we keep removing leaves from outside ,and come into the center nodes as answers


1. construct the graph in the form of an adjaceny list
2. add to the leaves arraylist if neightbour count =1 
3. As there can be only 1 or 2 centroids in any given graph , 

centroids=number of nodes 
while( centroids >2)
{
        c-=leaves ; //as leaves cannot be centroids anyways 
        for(int leaf : leaves)
        {
            //get neighbours of leaf 
            x=arraylist.get(leaf).iterator().next();
            //get elemets correspsodng to x , remove leaf from x
            arraylist.get(x).remove(leaf)
            newsleaves=[]
            //after removig , if length ==1 , add it to a newleaves arraylist
            if(arraylist.get(x).size()==1)
                newleaves.add(x)

        }
    leaves=newleaves;


}
